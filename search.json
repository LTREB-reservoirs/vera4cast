    "text": "2 Generating a forecast\n\n2.1 All forecasting approaches are welcome\nWe encourage you to use any modeling approach to make a prediction about the future conditions at the two LTREB reservoirs or the stream that connects them.\n\n\n2.2 Must include uncertainty\nForecasts require you to make an assessment of the confidence in your prediction of the future. You can represent your confidence (i.e., uncertainty in the forecast) using a distribution or numerically using an ensemble (or sample) of predictions.\n\n\n2.3 Any model drivers/covariates/features are welcome\nYou can use any data as model inputs (including all of the forecast target data available to date). All sensor-based target data are available in near-real time (1-day latency). You may want to use the updated target data to re-train a model or for use in data assimilation.\nAs VERA is a genuine forecasting challenge, you will need forecasted drivers if your model uses drivers as inputs. If you are interested in using forecasted meteorology for the VERA sites, we have developed an R package (https://github.com/FLARE-forecast/RopenMeteo) that can be used to access ensemble weather forecasts or seasonal forecasts for the sites. The R package is a wrapper around the open-meteo.com API. The README in the R package repo provides instructions for use.\n\n\n2.4 Forecasts can be for a range of horizons\nForecasts can be submitted at the daily time step for 1 day to 10 years ahead into the future.\n\n\n2.5 Forecasts can be submitted everyday\nSince forecasts can be submitted every day, automation is important. We provide an example GitHub repository that can be used to automate your forecast with GitHub Actions. It also includes the use of a custom Docker Container rqthomas/vera4cast:latest that has many of the R packages and functions needed to generate and submit forecasts."

    "text": "4 Representing uncertainity\nUncertainty is represented through the family - parameter columns.\n\n4.0.1 Parameteric forecast\nFor a parametric forecast with a normal distribution, the family column would have the word normal to designate a normal distribution and the parameter column must have values of mu and sigma for each forecasted variable, site_id, depth, and time combination.\nParameteric forecasts for binary variables should use bernoulli as the distribution.\nThe following names and parameterization of the distribution are currently supported by VERA (family: parameters):\n\nlognormal: mu, sigma\nnormal: mu,sigma\nbernoulli: prob\nbeta: shape1, shape2\nuniform: min, max\ngamma: shape, rate\nlogistic: location, scale\nexponential: rate\npoisson: lambda\n\nIf you are submitting a forecast that is not in the supported list, we recommend using the ensemble format and sampling from your distribution to generate a set of ensemble members that represents your forecast distribution.\n\n\n4.0.2 Ensemble (or sample) forecast\nEnsemble (or sample) forecasts use the family value of ensemble and the parameter values are the ensemble index.\nWhen forecasts using the ensemble family are scored, we assume that the ensemble is a set of equally likely realizations that are sampled from a distribution that is comparable to that of the observations (i.e., no broad adjustments are required to make the ensemble more consistent with observations). This is referred to as a “perfect ensemble” by Bröcker and Smith (2007). Ensemble (or sample) forecasts are transformed to a probability distribution function (e.g., dressed) using the default methods in the scoringRules R package (empirical version of the quantile decomposition for the crps and kernel density estimation using a Gaussian kernel for the logs). Kernel density estimation uses the default bandwidth produced by the bw.nrd function in the R stats package.\n\n\n4.1 Example forecasts\nHere is an example of a forecast that has a normal distribution:\n\ndf &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://renc.osn.xsede.org/bio230121-bucket01/vera4cast/forecasts/raw/T20231001231345_daily-2023-10-01-climatology.csv.gz\", show_col_types = FALSE)\ndplyr::glimpse(df)\n\nRows: 288\nColumns: 11\n$ model_id           &lt;chr&gt; \"climatology\", \"climatology\", \"climatology\", \"clima…\n$ datetime           &lt;date&gt; 2023-10-02, 2023-10-02, 2023-10-02, 2023-10-02, 20…\n$ reference_datetime &lt;date&gt; 2023-10-01, 2023-10-01, 2023-10-01, 2023-10-01, 20…\n$ site_id            &lt;chr&gt; \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bv…\n$ variable           &lt;chr&gt; \"Chla_ugL_mean\", \"Chla_ugL_mean\", \"Temp_C_mean\", \"T…\n$ family             &lt;chr&gt; \"normal\", \"normal\", \"normal\", \"normal\", \"normal\", \"…\n$ parameter          &lt;chr&gt; \"mu\", \"sigma\", \"mu\", \"sigma\", \"mu\", \"sigma\", \"mu\", …\n$ prediction         &lt;dbl&gt; 10.041987, 2.587292, 18.331126, 2.531732, 9.541139,…\n$ depth_m            &lt;dbl&gt; 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1…\n$ project_id         &lt;chr&gt; \"vera4cast\", \"vera4cast\", \"vera4cast\", \"vera4cast\",…\n$ duration           &lt;chr&gt; \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P…\n\n\nFor an ensemble (or sample) forecast, the family column uses the word ensemble to designate that it is an ensemble forecast and the parameter column is the ensemble member number (1, 2, 3 …)\n\ndf &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://renc.osn.xsede.org/bio230121-bucket01/vera4cast/forecasts/raw/T20231001231348_daily-2023-10-01-persistenceRW.csv.gz\", show_col_types = FALSE)\ndplyr::glimpse(df)\n\nRows: 28,800\nColumns: 11\n$ model_id           &lt;chr&gt; \"persistenceRW\", \"persistenceRW\", \"persistenceRW\", …\n$ datetime           &lt;dttm&gt; 2023-10-02, 2023-10-03, 2023-10-04, 2023-10-05, 20…\n$ reference_datetime &lt;dttm&gt; 2023-10-01, 2023-10-01, 2023-10-01, 2023-10-01, 20…\n$ site_id            &lt;chr&gt; \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bv…\n$ family             &lt;chr&gt; \"ensemble\", \"ensemble\", \"ensemble\", \"ensemble\", \"en…\n$ parameter          &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n$ variable           &lt;chr&gt; \"Chla_ugL_mean\", \"Chla_ugL_mean\", \"Chla_ugL_mean\", …\n$ prediction         &lt;dbl&gt; 10.59539, 13.04463, 13.86989, 13.81281, 14.09787, 1…\n$ depth_m            &lt;dbl&gt; 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1…\n$ project_id         &lt;chr&gt; \"vera4cast\", \"vera4cast\", \"vera4cast\", \"vera4cast\",…\n$ duration           &lt;chr&gt; \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P…"
