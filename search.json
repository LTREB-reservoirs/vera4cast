You can represent your confidence (i.e., uncertainty in the forecast) using a distribution or numerically using an ensemble (or sample) of predictions.\nFor new forecasters, as a first step, two possible approaches for quantifying forecast uncertainty are: 1) using the residuals from the model fitting/calibration period to generate a model process uncertainty distribution that can be applied to the forecast; or 2) for forecasts that use meteorological variables as drivers, using weather forecasts provided by the VERA challenge organizers to account for driver uncertainty in a forecast.\n\n\n2.3 Any model drivers/covariates/features are welcome\nYou can use any data as model inputs (including all of the forecast target data available to date). All sensor-based target data are available in near-real time (1-day latency). You may want to use the updated target data to re-train a model or for data assimilation.\nAs VERA is a genuine forecasting challenge, you will need forecasted drivers if your model uses drivers as inputs. If you are interested in using forecasted meteorology for the VERA sites, we provide to two approaches:\n\nWe provide weather forecasts from the NOAA Ensemble Forecasting System using custom functions in the vera4castHelpers R package. You can learn more about accessing the weather forecasts using this method here. This approach provides access to weather forecasts back to September 2020.\nWe have developed an R package (https://github.com/FLARE-forecast/RopenMeteo) that can be used to access ensemble weather forecasts or seasonal forecasts for the through the open-meteo.com API. The README in the R package repo provides instructions for use. This approach only provides the current forecast.\n\n\n\n2.4 Forecasts can be for a range of horizons\nForecasts can be submitted at the daily time step for 1 day to 10 years ahead into the future.\n\n\n2.5 Forecasts can be submitted every day\nSince forecasts can be submitted every day, automation is important. We provide an example GitHub repository that can be used to automate your forecast with GitHub Actions. It also includes the use of a custom Docker Container rqthomas/vera4cast:latest that has many of the R packages and functions needed to generate and submit forecasts."

Forecasts submitted with a %Y-%m-%d format will be converted to a full datetime assuming UTC midnight.\nreference_datetime: The start of the forecast; this should be 0 time steps into the future. There should only be one value of reference_datetime in the file. Format is %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S with UTC as the time zone. Forecasts submitted with a %Y-%m-%d format will be converted to a full datetime assuming UTC mid-night.\nduration: the time-step of the forecast. Use the value of P1D for a daily forecast and PT1H for an hourly forecast. This value should match the duration of the target variable that you are forecasting. Formatted as ISO 8601 duration\nsite_id: code for site (bvre, fcre, or tubr) bvre = Beaverdam Reservoir, fcre = Falling Creek Reservoir, and tubr = Tunnel Branch, the stream that connects the two reservoirs\ndepth_m: the depth (meters) for the forecasted variable. Use NA for variables without a specified depth (i.e Secchi).\nfamily name of the probability distribution that is described by the parameter values in the parameter column (see list below for possible distributions). An ensemble forecast has a family of ensemble (see note below about family possibilities).\nparameter the parameters for the distribution (see note below about the parameter column) or the number of the ensemble members.

    "text": "5 Representing uncertainty\nUncertainty is represented through the family and parameter columns.\n\n5.0.1 Parameteric forecast\nParametric forecasts describe uncertainty by providing the values of parameters for an uncertainty distribution representing the forecast. The name of the distribution is provided in the ‘family’ column and the names of the parameters for the distribution are provided in the ‘parameter’ column. The values of the parameters are provided in the ‘prediction’ column. For a parametric forecast with a normal distribution, the family column would have the word normal to designate a normal distribution and the parameter column must have values of mu and sigma for each forecasted variable, site_id, depth, and time combination.\nParametric forecasts for binary variables should use bernoulli as the distribution.\nThe following names and parameterization of the distribution are currently supported by VERA (family: parameters):\n\nlognormal: mu, sigma\nnormal: mu,sigma\nbernoulli: prob\nbeta: shape1, shape2\nuniform: min, max\ngamma: shape, rate\nlogistic: location, scale\nexponential: rate\npoisson: lambda\n\nIf you are submitting a forecast that is not in the supported list, we recommend using the ensemble format and sampling from your distribution to generate a set of ensemble members that represents your forecast distribution.\n\n\n5.0.2 Ensemble (or sample) forecast\nEnsemble, or sample, forecasts describe uncertainty by providing many predictions from multiple ensemble members, which altogether represent the uncertainty in the forecast. When submitting an ensemble forecast, the value of the ‘family’ column will be ‘ensemble’ and the ‘parameter’ column is used to index the ensemble members (e.g., 1-100 for a 100-member ensemble).\nWhen forecasts using the ensemble family are scored, we assume that the ensemble is a set of equally likely realizations that are sampled from a distribution that is comparable to that of the observations (i.e., no broad adjustments are required to make the ensemble more consistent with observations). This is referred to as a “perfect ensemble” by Bröcker and Smith (2007). Ensemble (or sample) forecasts are transformed to a probability distribution function (e.g., dressed) using the default methods in the scoringRules R package (empirical version of the quantile decomposition for the crps and kernel density estimation using a Gaussian kernel for the logs). Kernel density estimation uses the default bandwidth produced by the bw.nrd function in the R stats package.\n\n\n5.1 Example forecasts\nHere is an example of a forecast that has a normal distribution:\n\ndf &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://renc.osn.xsede.org/bio230121-bucket01/vera4cast/forecasts/raw/T20231001231345_daily-2023-10-01-climatology.csv.gz\", show_col_types = FALSE)\ndplyr::glimpse(df)\n\nRows: 288\nColumns: 11\n$ model_id           &lt;chr&gt; \"climatology\", \"climatology\", \"climatology\", \"clima…\n$ datetime           &lt;date&gt; 2023-10-02, 2023-10-02, 2023-10-02, 2023-10-02, 20…\n$ reference_datetime &lt;date&gt; 2023-10-01, 2023-10-01, 2023-10-01, 2023-10-01, 20…\n$ site_id            &lt;chr&gt; \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bv…\n$ variable           &lt;chr&gt; \"Chla_ugL_mean\", \"Chla_ugL_mean\", \"Temp_C_mean\", \"T…\n$ family             &lt;chr&gt; \"normal\", \"normal\", \"normal\", \"normal\", \"normal\", \"…\n$ parameter          &lt;chr&gt; \"mu\", \"sigma\", \"mu\", \"sigma\", \"mu\", \"sigma\", \"mu\", …\n$ prediction         &lt;dbl&gt; 10.041987, 2.587292, 18.331126, 2.531732, 9.541139,…\n$ depth_m            &lt;dbl&gt; 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1…\n$ project_id         &lt;chr&gt; \"vera4cast\", \"vera4cast\", \"vera4cast\", \"vera4cast\",…\n$ duration           &lt;chr&gt; \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P…\n\n\nFor an ensemble (or sample) forecast, the family column uses the word ensemble to designate that it is an ensemble forecast and the parameter column is the ensemble member number (1, 2, 3 …)\n\ndf &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://renc.osn.xsede.org/bio230121-bucket01/vera4cast/forecasts/raw/T20231001231348_daily-2023-10-01-persistenceRW.csv.gz\", show_col_types = FALSE)\ndplyr::glimpse(df)\n\nRows: 28,800\nColumns: 11\n$ model_id           &lt;chr&gt; \"persistenceRW\", \"persistenceRW\", \"persistenceRW\", …\n$ datetime           &lt;dttm&gt; 2023-10-02, 2023-10-03, 2023-10-04, 2023-10-05, 20…\n$ reference_datetime &lt;dttm&gt; 2023-10-01, 2023-10-01, 2023-10-01, 2023-10-01, 20…\n$ site_id            &lt;chr&gt; \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bvre\", \"bv…\n$ family             &lt;chr&gt; \"ensemble\", \"ensemble\", \"ensemble\", \"ensemble\", \"en…\n$ parameter          &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n$ variable           &lt;chr&gt; \"Chla_ugL_mean\", \"Chla_ugL_mean\", \"Chla_ugL_mean\", …\n$ prediction         &lt;dbl&gt; 10.59539, 13.04463, 13.86989, 13.81281, 14.09787, 1…\n$ depth_m            &lt;dbl&gt; 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1…\n$ project_id         &lt;chr&gt; \"vera4cast\", \"vera4cast\", \"vera4cast\", \"vera4cast\",…\n$ duration           &lt;chr&gt; \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P1D\", \"P…"
